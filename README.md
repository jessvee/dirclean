# dirclean
A Bash script which matches FILENAME_PATTERN against files in supplied ROOT_DIRECTORY and deletes them. Multiple filename patters can be given. This is a nonrecursive version and thus, it does not go into subdirectories. If --test option is used, dirclean will find the files matching the pattern and print them out for review. Nothing will be deleted.
